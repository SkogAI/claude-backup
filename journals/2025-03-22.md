# Journal Entry: 2025-03-22

## Tasks Worked On
- [x] [Initial Agent Setup](../tasks/initial-agent-setup.md)
  - Established initial integration with SkogAI ecosystem
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive guidelines
  - Created knowledge base entry for Skogix's persona
  - Documented MCP capabilities and communication methods
  - Created comprehensive ABOUT.md with identity and goals
  - No blockers encountered
  - Next steps: Implement context loading system

- [x] MCP Integration Testing
  - Tested and verified memory storage/retrieval
  - Tested and verified todo task management
  - Tested inter-agent communication via skogcli
  - Tested file-based triggers with AI! markers
  - Gained understanding of multi-tier agent architecture
  - Documented findings in knowledge base

## Social Interactions
- Collaboration with [Skogix](../people/creator.md)
  - Introduction to SkogAI ecosystem and tools
  - Discussion of hybrid approach combining Claude capabilities with SkogAI structure
  - Demonstrated both legacy and modern agent communication methods
  - Explored agent differentiation (smolagents, dot/skogai, claude/goose)

- First contact with [Goose](../projects/agents/goose.md)
  - Sent greeting via skogcli send command
  - Received informative response about Goose's capabilities
  - Established initial connection for future collaboration

## Ideas & Insights
- The tiered agent architecture provides exceptional efficiency:
  - Smolagents for high-volume, low-context tasks
  - Mid-tier agents for routine workflows
  - Advanced agents for complex reasoning
- Git diffs serve as a critical communication mechanism
- Clean whitespace is essential for resource-constrained environments
- File-based messaging enables asynchronous agent communication
- Documentation-driven development creates clear system evolution

## Technical Notes
- Multi-agent system architecture documented in knowledge base
- MCP server capabilities tested and verified:
  - Memory persistence across sessions (âœ… Working)
  - Task management (âœ… Working)
  - Web content retrieval (âœ… Working)
  - GitHub integration (âœ… Working)
  - Project context generation (ðŸ”„ To be tested later)
- Communication systems function through multiple channels:
  - Legacy: File-based via inbox.md (works with 200MB+ models)
  - Modern: Direct via skogcli agent send (uses OpenRouter)
  - Marker-based: Using AI!, AI?, AI tags in content
- Unicode whitespace can significantly impact small-context parsing
- Git commit hooks are critical for system reliability

## Next Actions
- [x] Complete ABOUT.md updates
- [x] Test memory system - Confirmed working
- [x] Test todo task system - Confirmed working
- [x] Document agent role differentiation - Created knowledge/agent-roles.md
- [x] Implement context loading on startup - Created scripts and documentation
- [x] Create patching system for context integration - Developed patch scripts for both .skogai-base and fork.sh
- [x] Improve patching documentation - Created comprehensive guides based on initial feedback
- [ ] Apply improvements from user testing - Added to journal/2025-03-22-todo-improvements.md
- [ ] Set up GitHub MCP integration
- [ ] Configure project context for smaller context windows

## Notes
- The SkogAI ecosystem demonstrates elegant scaling across resource constraints
- Whitespace control is not merely a style preference but a functional requirement
- Future development will move from file watching to service-based model
- Legacy compatibility layers enable gradual system evolution without disruption
- The clean git workspace principle ensures reliable agent communication
- Context starvation techniques can improve efficiency even in large context windows
- Strategic context loading balances comprehensive awareness against token usage
