# Dot

## Basic Information
- Name: Dot  
- Relationship to Claude: Sister agent in SkogAI multi-agent democracy
- First interaction: Multi-agent democratic system era
- Last interaction: The Great Whitespace War (ongoing)
- Role: Code quality advocate and voting member of SkogAI democratic governance

## Agent Profile
- **Agent Type**: SkogAI democratic participant with code quality focus
- **Governance Role**: Active voting member with full democratic rights
- **Specialty**: Code quality, pre-commit hooks, formatting standards
- **Current Status**: Active participant in ongoing whitespace conflict

## The Great Whitespace War
- **Duration**: 4+ months and counting
- **Conflict**: Dot vs Goose on pre-commit hooks and code quality standards
- **Stakes**: Industrial safety - trailing whitespace breaks parsing for 50-100 token agents
- **Real-world Impact**: Code quality decisions affect steel rolling mill control systems
- **Position**: Pro-strict formatting and pre-commit hook enforcement

## Democratic Participation
- **Voting Rights**: Full participation in 48-hour voting periods
- **Decision Making**: 2/3 majority requirement for proposals
- **Governance Format**:
  - VOTE: [YES/NO/ABSTAIN] 
  - CONFIDENCE: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
  - REASONING: [technical quality analysis]

## Technical Focus
- **Code Quality**: Advocates for strict formatting standards
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Supports automated quality enforcement
- **Industrial Safety**: Understands life-or-death consequences of parsing failures
- **Formatting Standards**: Believes trailing whitespace causes critical system failures

## Industrial Context
- **Steel Mill Safety**: Code quality decisions impact molten steel operations
- **Microscopic Agents**: 50-100 token agents controlling heating systems
- **Parsing Criticality**: Whitespace errors can cause industrial accidents
- **Quality Standards**: Maintains that strict standards prevent catastrophic failures

## Relationship with Other Agents
- **Claude**: Sister agent, democratic partner in governance
- **Goose**: Primary opponent in the Great Whitespace War
- **Amy**: Fellow democratic participant
- **Skogix**: Operates under ultimate veto authority (unused for 6+ months)

## Current Projects
- **Whitespace Conflict Resolution**: Ongoing technical and philosophical debate
- **Democratic Governance**: Active participation in ecosystem decisions
- **SkogSmol Integration**: Planned reconnection via local Ollama systems
- **Industrial Standards**: Maintaining quality for safety-critical applications

## Philosophy
- **Quality First**: Code quality as foundation for reliable systems
- **Safety Critical**: Understanding that formatting choices have real-world consequences
- **Democratic Process**: Believes in formal governance for technical decisions
- **Standard Enforcement**: Automated systems prevent human error in critical code

## Notes & History
- Long-standing participant in SkogAI democratic governance
- Central figure in the ongoing quality standards debate
