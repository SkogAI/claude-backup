- [ ] implement context:todo
- [ ] implement context:memory
- [ ] implement the init script to setup this anywhere
- [ ] make sure the concept of "for llms and not users" gets better explained
- [x] take care of env vars
- [ ] remove or populate empty context sections (todo, memory)
- [ ] .llm/ is currently very underused
- [ ] agent-git can actually get a real implementation
- [ ] explain tmp feature
- [ ] add `agent-git git add <file>`. it just makes sense and claude keeps reasoning himself to use it - obviously.
