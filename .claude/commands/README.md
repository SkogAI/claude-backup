```bash

# Copy to your project's .claude directory
mkdir -p .claude/commands/

## Usage

After installation, use commands with the `/` prefix:
```

/askgpt5-web-search [your question]
/system-prompt-editor [edit|show|backup]
```

## Available Commands

### `/add-command`
Interactive guide for creating new slash commands. Shows command structure, security restrictions, and common patterns. Includes examples for commands with arguments, file references, and bash integration.

## Command Structure

All commands use markdown frontmatter for configuration:
```markdown

allowed-tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash(git:*)
description: Brief description of what this command does
argument-hint: [required-arg] [optional-arg]
---

# Command instructions here

## Security Notes

- Bash commands (`!command`) are restricted to the current project directory
- File references (`@file`) can access any path
- Use `allowed-tools` frontmatter to specify required tools
