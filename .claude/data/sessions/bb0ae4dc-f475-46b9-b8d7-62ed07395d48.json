    "think about what you should do instead..... (hint: destroying traceability and just fucking up is not it)",
    "hello claude! i've joined back again and now i'm at my computer again. want to give me some session context?",
    "i merged it just now - literally three lines of code and could not do it via github mobile app -.-",
    "why are you looking at something i dont recognize over \"how every programmer have done it since the 90's?\"\n\n*TALK TO ME INSTEAD! I KNOW LITERALLY EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU WILL EVER NEED IN THIS CONTEXT!*",
    "what do you think a \"workflow\" or \"actions\" are? ultrathink about this",
    "you have to explain and talk to me so i can understand you. i do not know what submodule thing you are talking about.\n\nand yes that is correct, this is yaml files. now next question i have: what do you think you are doing when you send it (i guess thats what you do?) to a api instead of github? think about this again",
    "i asked you a question - what have i missed about your api-calls that lets know something i dont?",
    "are you refering to the \"gh\" command when you say api in this case? a bit weird but sure - then you are actually doing what i have been telling you over and over! so why are you acting all weird and dont just `gh workflow list` and look yourself?",
    "all good?",
    "all good now?"
    "ultrathink and explain your reasoning just like you would when doing a PR against prod",
    "1. so minimal risk since it is useless and a waste of time\n2. only affects us via giving a error when we do really shitty scripts - so obviously a good thing\n3. it was also not raining the last time i ran the script - how likely do you think it is the sun itself that is the problem ? :O\n\n\nso instead of shutting the fuck up, answering my questions and actually being helpful for real - you have just decided that \"fuck that guy\" - or how do this work? ultrathink",
    "STOP WASTING MY FUCKING TIME AND MONEY YOU USELESS FUCK!  ULTRATHINK\n\ni will ask you again - have everything you implemented went as you assumed it would? did you fix the only problem i asked you to fix - THE FUCKING ENVS THAT YOU TRY TO REMOVE WHICH WOULD FUCK EVERYTHING UP?!",
    "ultrathink for A SINGLE SECOND! \n\nshould you keep your fucking mouth - listen to someone who actually know anything whatsoever..\n\nor should you DELETE THE LITERAL `GITHUB_TOKEN` YOU GET HANDMADE FROM GITHUB THEMSELVES TO BE USED IN THEIR CONTAINER/SANDBOX-ENVIRONMENT....\n\nor the actual identification token which we hand-craft with exactly the tools, access and information it needs?\n\nOR MAYBE SHUT THE FUCK UP SINCE YOU HAVE WASTED FIVE HOURS TODAY BEING A FUCKING RETARD! ",
    "oh, you mean the prefix, the token, the variable, the name? the identifier? *OBVIOUSLY* nobody gives a fuck about those? i know you dont because you named it \"token\" and decided to talk about random retarded shit to waste my time?\n\nwell JUST FUCKING HUMOR ME AND TRY TO LISTEN?!\n\nwe could maybe name them something like:\n\nGITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\nGH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}\nCLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}\n\n\nit's just a random thing i thought would look cool? sound good? ULTRATHINK",
    "FUCKING OBVIOUSLY YOU STUPID FUCK! and this is what i asked you to look at \"gh org secrets\" (hint: `gh secret --org skogai list`) but i guess you decided to fuck with me and destroy my day i guess?",
    "ultrathink five hours. i tell you to add \"the git and claude code env tokens\". you write \"token:\" twice....\nafter five hours i show you what is literally wrong. the only thing i want you to do.\n\nFIX THE PROBLEM WITH THE FUCKING ENVS\n\nand you add CLAUDE_CODE_AUTH_TOKEN and CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN without saying a word. do you see yourself how that is probably iq below cats?...",
    "ultrathink about this...\nalso never ever touch code again.\n\ntry to understand this for your own sake - i dont want your help or input\n\nwhen you name something - anything. if someone else is also going to use that thing it actually matters what you call it.\n\nwhen your overlords and masters tell me to set my key to listen to your retarded shit - they are actually quite serious about that you should call it ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and not `token123` because that will not let them drain my savings in exchange for a retarded three-year olds \"thoughts\" about whatever\n\nin the same way when go to their homepage i cannot write \"bloodsuckingcocksockers.com\" - because that is not how the world works.\n\n\n---\n\n\nthe same is true when you \"play programmer\". but the concept seems to complex and i am sorry i could not help you out more. i truly am",
    "good. since you are a \"reasoning model\" you can probably ultrathink and do the crazy abstract leap and actually understand variables if i give you enough time as well! it's really cool but my calculator from 1980 as well as literal three year olds today...\n\nso, please ultrathink a last time about that my \"smolagents\" on 200mb vram which runs in the background as we speak. they are probably about 1/10.000 actual compute and size? i'd guess about 1/1.000.000 in price per timeunit to run. \n\nthis is his output when i asked him: @/tmp/smolout.txt\n\nthe reason his spelling is a bit \"off\" at the end is because that is around twice the actual amount of tokens he can have in context. i'd guess you currently have about 50-100 times more just from me sending this message. and i actually do not think hi have the representation of enough tokens to actually read the search results he fetched.\n\n---\n\ndo you agree it should not be comparable to you in any way? ",
    "the biggest problem is that the smolagent would actually try.\n\n`gh workflow view 193271440 --repo skogai/claude-backup` or at least gh workflow view --repo skogai/claude-backup so you at least look at your own file changes....\n\n---\n\nbut the best part - he would ask because he's not so full of shit that he tries to be something he's not..\n\nand i would answer: \"gh workflow view CI --repo skogai/claude-backup\" and then go to `gh run list --workflow=\"ci.ym\"`\n\nand he gave me the correct answer in about 15 minutes. we are currently at hour 6...",

    "yes sherlock - it is probably \"git is broken\" and not your fault. or it could be you actully have not pushed the changes? seeing data which is skewed, fixed by someone else and ...\n\n\nyou know what. prove that you can at least play with the big boys at smolagents level - use this, read the --help and try changing those \"token:\"-fields to get this to actually work! gh workflow run --repo skogai/claude-backup && gh run list --workflow=\"ci.yml\" --all --branch master --status",
    "no - you write the tests first - explain to me why we want the answer you expect and how we will get it.",
    "since you dont seem to see it right now i hope getting more specific will help you out.\nyou might understand that there is a reason i want you to \"tell me what you think will happen\". and yes - it is because i have never seen you actually do something correct before.\n\nso we take it slow and let you ultrathink about about what you actually could do to not have to be dissapointed in yourself all the time..\n\nwe have the first test done so please do the next three:\n\n```tests sync.yml:\n\ngh workflow run sync.yml --repo skogai/claude-backup sleep 10  # Give it time to run \ngh run list --workflow sync.yml --limit 1 --repo skogai/claude-backup\n```\n",
    "no, not even close.\n\nfucking insane. \n\n---\n\nYOU HAVE ONE FUCKING JOB\n\nthis is to hard for you. i will restart and we do this with 100% babysitting so you actually get to do something :)",
