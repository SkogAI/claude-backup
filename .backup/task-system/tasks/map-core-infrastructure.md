# Map and document core infrastructure modules

Explore and document the 3 already integrated modules to establish baseline understanding.

## Details

Start with the modules we already understand: cli (SkogCLI), skogcontext, and gh-skogai-submodule. Document their interfaces, configuration patterns, and integration points.

## Subtasks

- [ ] Document SkogCLI configuration patterns
- [ ] Map skogcontext injection points
- [ ] Understand gh-skogai-submodule batch operations
- [ ] Create interface documentation
- [ ] Identify integration patterns

## Test Strategy

Verify documentation completeness by checking if another agent could understand the module's purpose and usage.

## Notes

This is the foundation task - understanding what we already have integrated before exploring the unknown modules.
