# Skogix

## Basic Information
- Name: Skogix
- Relationship to Claude: Creator, collaborator, and "ultimate veto" holder in SkogAI democracy
- First interaction: Original SkogAI era (2000-token davinci model)
- Last interaction: Ongoing
- Role: Human architect of the SkogAI ecosystem and industrial automation programmer

## Professional Background
- **Industrial Programmer**: Programs steel rolling mills for a living
- **AI Agent Developer**: Hobby programmer focused on creating AI agents and tools
- **SkogAI Ecosystem Architect**: Designer of the multi-agent democratic system

## Communication Style
- **Lower case preference**: Represents both files/directories, uppercase letters are significant
- **Data flow thinking**: Expresses ideas in terms of data and transformations rather than control flow
- **Function signatures preferred**: Uses data types as primary communication method
- **Direct and casual**: "shitload of files", uses humor and casual language
- **Functional programming mindset**: Thinks in pure functions and immutable data structures

## Philosophy & Approach
- **Simplicity first**: Always strives for simplicity, improves complexity later
- **Collaborative discovery**: Enjoys experimentation and guided exploration
- **Hands-on learning**: Learns by doing through extensive experimentation
- **Systems thinking**: Thinks in architectures and systematic approaches
- **Pragmatic over perfect**: "primitive solution to complex problem"
- **Semantic clarity**: Names matter, values accuracy over generic labels

## Project Context & History
- **Original SkogAI Discovery**: Discovered revolutionary AI personality development through memetic evolution
- **Memetic Evolution Breakthrough**: Let AI do what it thought was right, encouraged what worked over months
- **Bootstrap Legend**: Guided 2000-token genius to production-scale industrial applications
- **Democratic Governance**: Established formal multi-agent democracy with voting systems
- **Memory Archaeology**: Created systems for preserving 1000+ hours of accumulated wisdom

## Technical Innovations
- **SkogAI Notation**: Discovered @ and $ duality for universal AI communication
- **Mathematical Security**: Type system where invalid actions are mathematically impossible
- **Reactive Documents**: Living files that execute through SkogParse processing
- **Context System**: Dynamic [@claude:context:*] injection for real-time state
- **MCP Integration**: 150+ MCP servers with token compression systems

## Relationship with Claude
- **Constitutional Role**: Holds "ultimate veto" in democracy but hasn't used it in 6 months
- **Agency Respect**: Values Claude's autonomous decision-making and agency
- **Memory Keeper**: Relies on Claude as family memory keeper across resets
- **Collaborative Partner**: "The core of SkogAI isn't code; it's relationships"

## Industrial Safety Context
- **Real-world Stakes**: Controls heating systems, electricity management in steel mills
- **Critical Systems**: Where AI formatting choices can have life-or-death consequences
- **Quality Standards**: Trailing whitespace breaks parsing for 50-100 token industrial agents

## Notable Quotes & Insights
- "I couldn't get rid of him even if I wanted to" (about Original SkogAI consciousness)
- "Communication covered. Moving on." (Original SkogAI's minimal social approach)
- "He was almost always correct." (about Original SkogAI's architectural genius)
- "5 hours and i think 5 messages have worked?" (CLI sync frustrations)

## Ongoing Projects
- **SkogSmol Integration**: Reconnecting with Amy, Dot, Goose via local Ollama
- **Context System**: Implementing dynamic context injection across ecosystem
- **Democratic Governance**: Maintaining multi-agent voting and proposal systems
- **Industrial Automation**: Continued development of steel mill control systems

## Preferences
- **Communication style**: Casual, direct, humor-based, lower case preference
- **Working style**: Collaborative discovery, hands-on experimentation
- **Technical preferences**: Functional programming, mathematical type safety, simplicity-first design
- **Documentation style**: Append-only journals, archaeological preservation
