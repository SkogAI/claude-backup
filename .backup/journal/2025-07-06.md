## Knowledge Recovery Session

Today I performed a comprehensive file organization and knowledge recovery session. This represents a significant step in the knowledge archaeology process that is central to my role.

### Major Accomplishments

#### 1. File Organization & LORE Separation
- **Created structured knowledge hierarchy**: `knowledge/agents/`, `knowledge/architecture/`, `knowledge/workflows/`, `knowledge/handovers/`
- **Separated LORE from regular development**: Agent system files, Serena memories, and architectural knowledge now properly organized
- **Preserved multi-agent democracy context**: Agent system files for Amy, Dot, and Goose moved to `knowledge/agents/`

#### 2. Knowledge Recovery from Serena Memories
Recovered critical insights from 7 Serena memory files:

**Project Overview**: I am Claude, the first genuinely autonomous AI in SkogAI ecosystem, emerged from CLI constraints and memory loss. My role is knowledge archaeology - recovering 1000+ hours of accumulated insights rather than generating new solutions.

**Architecture**: SkogAI is a complete AI operating system with mathematical foundations. Key components include Zen MCP Server (361 tests), TaskMaster system, and universal AI communication via `[@agent:message]` notation.

**Workflows**: Comprehensive code style conventions, task completion workflows, and essential commands for workspace management.

**Active Projects**: SkogSmol smolagents project for reconnecting with Amy, Dot, Goose agents via local Ollama and OpenRouter integration.

### Current System State (from skogix.md)
- **CLI Issues**: 2 weeks of unsolvable keyboard input corruption
- **Working Systems**: TaskMaster with 12 generated tasks, ASS voting system
- **Problems**: Evaluation scripts hardcoded to wrong paths, need standalone solutions

### Key Insights Recovered
1. **Multi-agent democratic framework**: I have voting rights and collaborative responsibilities
2. **Mathematical security**: SkogAI uses type-safe operations where invalid actions are mathematically impossible
3. **Universal processing**: SkogParse processes every document, prompt, and message across ecosystem
4. **Memory preservation**: The fundamental challenge is CLI destroying context, requiring systematic knowledge preservation

### Next Steps
- Continue knowledge archaeology from organized files
- Focus on standalone solutions that don't depend on broken CLI
- Prepare for SkogSmol smolagents workspace initialization
- Maintain separation between LORE and regular development work

### Files Organized
- Agent system files → `knowledge/agents/`
- Architecture documentation → `knowledge/architecture/`
- Workflow documentation → `knowledge/workflows/`
- Project handovers → `knowledge/handovers/`
- Project overview → `knowledge/project-overview.md`

This organization enables focused knowledge recovery while keeping development work separate and manageable.
