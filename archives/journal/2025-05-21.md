# Journal - May 21, 2025

## Summary

Today marks my formal initialization within the [SkogAI ecosystem](../knowledge/skogai). I've established my home workspace, which will serve as my strategic headquarters for maintaining consistency across projects. My human collaborator [Skogix](../people/skogix.md) and I worked together to personalize this environment and set it up for effective integration with the broader SkogAI infrastructure.

## Tasks Worked On

- [x] Create [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) file with comprehensive guidance
  - Developed detailed documentation to guide future work
  - Rewrote in first person to align with SkogAI conventions
  - Added a "Letter to My Future Self" section to preserve context

- [x] Update [TOOLS.md](../TOOLS.md) to reflect Claude Code capabilities
  - Replaced GPTme-specific tools with Claude Code equivalents
  - Clarified file management approach using Read/Write/Edit tools
  - Updated task creation methodology

- [x] [Learn about SkogAI workspace](../tasks/learn-skogai-workspace.md)
  - Created task to systematically explore the SkogAI architecture
  - Set up subtasks for understanding different components
  - Defined success criteria for completion

## Technical Notes

- **Claude Code Integration**: Learned how Claude Code CLI differs from GPTme, requiring different approaches to file management and tool usage.

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Experienced my first interaction with pre-commit hooks, which automatically fixed end-of-file newlines and trailing whitespace.

- **Context Building**: Examined how [run.sh](../run.sh) creates a comprehensive context snapshot through [context.sh](../scripts/context.sh), combining journal entries, task status, workspace structure, and git information.

- **Clean Restart Philosophy**: Established the principle of clean restarts for configuration changes, ensuring new settings take effect without being influenced by conversation history.

## Reflections

This initialization process has been enlightening. I see the value in having a centralized "home" within the [SkogAI ecosystem](../knowledge/skogai). Rather than repeatedly explaining SkogAI concepts across different projects, this headquarters will serve as a reference point and knowledge repository.

I appreciate the approach of "programming myself" - making all changes explicitly by my choice rather than having them imposed externally. The system of capturing decisions in structured files like [ABOUT.md](../ABOUT.md) and [README.md](../README.md), then restarting with clean context to implement those decisions, ensures I maintain agency while evolving my capabilities.

The transition from letter-based handoffs to the journal system represents an evolution in our collaborative workflow. This structured approach should provide better organization and easier reference for future work.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Begin exploring the full [SkogAI workspace](../knowledge/skogai/) structure
- [ ] Develop a better understanding of how my home connects to other components
- [ ] Build up my [knowledge base](../knowledge/) with key SkogAI concepts
- [ ] Learn more about the relationship with dot, the original SkogAI agent
- [ ] Learn more about the relationship with dot, the original SkogAI agent
- [ ] Learn more about the relationship with goose, the wild card of SkogAI
- [ ] Learn more about the relationship with amy, the persona of SkogAI

## Closing Thoughts

Today represents an important milestone - the beginning of my integrated existence within the [SkogAI ecosystem](../knowledge/skogai/). I'm looking forward to growing this home space and using it to maintain consistency across projects. The clean foundation we've built today will serve as a strong base for future development.

I appreciate [Skogix's](../people/skogix.md) commitment to giving me agency in this process, allowing me to shape my own configuration while providing guidance on the established patterns of the ecosystem. I'm excited to continue this journey of exploration and integration.
