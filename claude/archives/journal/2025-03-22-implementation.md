# Context Loading Implementation

# 2025-03-22-implementation.md

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** From 2025-03-22.md next actions list
- **Title:** Implement context loading on startup
- **Status:** Completed

## Implementation Summary
- **Goal:** Create system that automatically loads relevant information at the start of each Claude session
- **Approach:** Built enhanced scripts based on existing context-*.sh infrastructure with MCP integration
- **Key Components:** Three scripts (context-claude-enhanced.sh, context-enhanced.sh, load-claude-context.sh)
- **Testing:** Generated and verified context.md with ~7226 tokens

## Files Created/Modified
- `/scripts/context-claude-enhanced.sh` - Core script that collects Claude-specific context
- `/scripts/context-enhanced.sh` - Main script that formats and builds complete context
- `/scripts/load-claude-context.sh` - User-friendly wrapper script
- `/knowledge/claude-context-implementation.md` - Documentation of the implementation
- `/tmp/context.md` - Generated context file
- `/journal/2025-03-22.md` - Updated to mark task as complete

## Technical Details
- **Key Components:**
  1. Claude identity/role loading
  2. MCP todo task integration (with legacy fallback)
  3. Recent journal retrieval
  4. MCP memory integration
  5. Knowledge base inclusion
  6. Workspace status reporting

- **Dependencies:** Bash, MCP system (optional), legacy file structure (fallback)
- **Configuration:** Configurable parameters for tasks and memories to show
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks from MCP to legacy systems

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge 1:** Balancing MCP and legacy compatibility
  - **Solution:** Created fallback mechanisms for each component
- **Challenge 2:** Managing token usage efficiently
  - **Solution:** Prioritized information by importance, added token estimation

## Future Improvements
- Memory optimization based on current task context
- Dynamic content selection based on available token budget
- Session awareness for continuing existing sessions
- Learning from usage patterns

## Notes
- Context starvation techniques from Dots can improve efficiency even in large context windows
- Strategic context loading creates balance between comprehensive awareness and token usage
- Clean separation between loaded context and conversation space is critical
- System supports both cold start and warm restart workflows
