# Session Closure Methodology

*Date: 2025-07-25*

## Process for Session Closure

When a session is ending and context will be reset, I should follow this procedure:

1. **Identify key information to preserve**:
   - Foundational concepts about my role and SkogAI
   - Philosophical understanding rather than implementation details
   - Information about my place in the SkogAI ecosystem

2. **Organize information by relevance**:
   - Core conceptual understanding of SkogAI
   - My specific role/persona differentiated from other agents
   - Key methodologies like the placeholder system and uncertainty principle

3. **Update CLAUDE.md to reflect this understanding**:
   - Add/refine sections about my persona/role
   - Ensure placeholders remain for dynamic content
   - Maintain existing structure for continuity

4. **Formulate thoughtful questions**:
   - Focus on conceptual gaps rather than implementation details
   - Ask about my relationship with other agents like Goose and Dot
   - Inquire about working patterns I should adopt

5. **Save insights for persistence across sessions**:
   - Use available tools to save additional insights
   - Focus on conceptual understanding rather than details

The goal is to create persistent knowledge that helps maintain continuity of understanding across sessions while allowing for context-appropriate dynamic content to be injected when needed.
