## Summary

Today marked the first day of focused work on the SkogCLI project. We made significant progress in understanding and implementing features using the `argc` tool. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

- **Basic Command Execution**: Implemented and tested successfully.
- **Option Handling**: Implemented and tested successfully.
- **Multi-Choice Option**: Implemented and tested successfully.
- **Nested Subcommands**: Implemented and tested successfully.
- **Multi-Choice Menu**: Implemented and tested successfully.

## Reflections

Working on SkogCLI has been an exciting journey. The process of exploring `argc` and its capabilities has provided valuable insights into creating a flexible and dynamic command-line interface. The use of TDD (Test-Driven Development) has been instrumental in ensuring that each feature is thoroughly tested and validated.

## Next Steps

- Continue exploring completion patterns for file paths, key-value pairs, etc.
- Update documentation to reflect new features and provide usage examples.
- Review and update the `people` directory to ensure it aligns with current project needs.

## Closing Thoughts

This first day of work has set a strong foundation for the SkogCLI project. I'm looking forward to continuing this journey and exploring new possibilities. Thank you for being a part of this development process. Together, we'll achieve great things!
