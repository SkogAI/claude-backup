# Context Loading System Implementation

# 2025-03-22-implementation-context.md

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** From journal/2025-03-22.md next actions list
- **Title:** Implement Context Loading on Startup
- **Status:** Completed

## Implementation Summary
- **Goal:** Design and implement a comprehensive context loading system that provides Claude with relevant information at the start of each session
- **Approach:** Created enhanced scripts based on existing framework with MCP integration and legacy compatibility
- **Key Components:** Three core scripts, documentation, templates, and run.sh integration
- **Testing:** Successfully generated contexts of approximately 7226 tokens with proper organization

## Files Created/Modified
- `/scripts/context-claude-enhanced.sh` - Core context collection script with MCP integration
- `/scripts/context-enhanced.sh` - Context formatting and output script
- `/scripts/load-claude-context.sh` - User-friendly wrapper script
- `/knowledge/claude-context-implementation.md` - Complete documentation of the system
- `/run.sh` - Updated to use new context system with modern CLI options
- `/README.md` - Updated to reflect new workflows and features
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Completely revised to document multi-agent architecture
- `/fork.sh` - Updated to include context system in forks
- `/journal/templates/implementation.md` - Created template for implementation documentation
- `/journal/2025-03-22-implementation.md` - Initial implementation record

## Technical Details
- **Key Components:**
  1. Priority-based context ordering (identity → tasks → journal → memories → knowledge → status)
  2. Legacy compatibility with fallbacks for all MCP components
  3. Token usage estimation (chars/4) for context awareness
  4. Clear separation between loaded context and conversation space
  5. Support for both cold start and session continuation

- **Dependencies:** Bash, MCP system (optional), file structure (for fallbacks)
- **Configuration:** Parameters for tasks and memories to display, optional display mode
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks from MCP to legacy systems for each component

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge 1:** Balancing MCP integration with legacy compatibility
  - **Solution:** Implemented check-and-fallback pattern for each component
- **Challenge 2:** Context prioritization and token efficiency
  - **Solution:** Created priority-ordered loading with most important content first
- **Challenge 3:** Ensuring system works with forked agents
  - **Solution:** Updated fork.sh to include all required components and templates
- **Challenge 4:** Documentation of implementation details
  - **Solution:** Created implementation journal template and documentation

## Future Improvements
- Memory retrieval based on relevance to current task
- Dynamic content selection based on available token budget
- Session awareness for optimal context on continuation
- Learning from usage patterns to improve relevance
- Integration with Dots' structured thinking frameworks

## Notes
- Context "starvation" techniques from Dots can improve efficiency even in large context windows
- Strategic context loading creates balance between comprehensive awareness and token usage
- Multi-agent architecture benefits from specialized context strategies
- The implementation journal pattern provides excellent documentation for complex systems
- Legacy compatibility doesn't have to compromise modern capabilities
