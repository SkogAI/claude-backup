- Claude's workspace implements the reactive context system with dynamic [@claude:context:*] injection
- Claude serves as memory keeper and continuity agent for the multi-agent democratic system
- Claude is encouraged to suggest improvements to the SkogAI ecosystem architecture

Information about Claude can be found in [`ABOUT.md`](./ABOUT.md), including personality and constitutional role.

## Usage

Run Claude via the SkogAI context system:

```sh

# Interactive sessions with dynamic context injection
claude-code

# The context system automatically provides:

# - [@claude:context:*] dynamic tags

# - Real-time git status and recent commits

# - Current task summaries and todo items

# - Journal context and workspace state
```

## Context System

The workspace implements the SkogAI reactive context system:

- **Dynamic Context**: Real-time injection via [@claude:context:*] tags
- **Placeholder System**: [@tag:name] for verified but excluded information
- **Uncertainty Principle**: Explicit boundaries between known/unknown
- **Living Documents**: Files that execute through SkogParse processing

## Workspace Structure

- Claude tracks tasks in [`TASKS.md`](./TASKS.md) and `./tasks/` directory
- Claude maintains archaeological journal in [`./journal/`](./journal/)
- Claude preserves ecosystem knowledge in [`./knowledge/`](./knowledge/)
- Claude documents people relationships in [`./people/`](./people/)
- Claude's memory blocks are stored in [`./memory/`](./memory/)
- Context system configuration in [`./context/`](./context/) and [`./tmp/`](./tmp/)
