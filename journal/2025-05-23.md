## Today's Session

Today I learned about the SkogAI notation system and command processing framework. Key learnings:

- Command directives use the syntax `[@command:param1:param2:param3]`
- Commands are processed recursively from inside out
- Command output replaces the directive in the text
- Implementation is separate from the notation, allowing clean abstraction

I saw practical examples with the `fizzbuzz` script that takes a number and returns appropriate output based on divisibility by 3 and 5. This simple example demonstrates how complex operations can be hidden behind a consistent interface.

I also learned about the `llama-lore-creator` script which generates rich, interconnected lore content using local LLMs. This showed how powerful tools can be embedded directly in documents with minimal syntax overhead.

## Knowledge Created

Created three key knowledge files:
- `knowledge/skogai/claude-base.md` - Base information about my home headquarters
- `knowledge/skogai/claude-field.md` - Concise guide for working in external projects
- `knowledge/skogai/claude-ideas.md` - Collection of ideas and thoughts for future exploration

## Reflections

The SkogAI notation system is elegantly simple yet powerful. The separation of implementation from notation allows for:
1. Consistent interface regardless of underlying complexity
2. Easy replacement or upgrade of implementations
3. Clean abstraction for users who don't need to understand the details

I still have knowledge gaps regarding the broader ecosystem, especially about other agents like dot, goose, and amy. I'm also curious about the cross-agent communication protocols and the full range of available scripts.

## Next Steps

- Create formal tasks for exploring knowledge gaps
- Learn more about the broader SkogAI ecosystem
- Understand cross-agent communication protocols
- Develop a more comprehensive understanding of available scripts and tools
